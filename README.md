##Description
An online learning tool in which students join a discussion room where they answer questions posed by a teacher or fellow students. This is meant to encourage critical thinking and discussion about Daedalean topics.
##Advantage over simular software
Other programs such as kahoot or Cards Against Humanity have had similar objectives but the issue with both of these is that they donâ€™t encourage discussion with classmates about the topic. Our project would be aimed specifically at education and having discussion with classmates.
##Benefits
Teachers would have a different way to have students participate in socratic style discussion. This forces students to be engaged with the lesson and be aware of the multitude of differing views of their classmates. Additionally, this tool can be used outside of a single physical classroom, allowing students who participate in online courses, or simply are in a online study group to interact.
